## Introduction

In this project, I created a virtual network environment using Oracle VirtualBox and deliberately introduced vulnerabilities by installing outdated software from various sources. The project steps included:

1. Creating our Oracle VirtualBox.
2. Preparing a Vulnerability Management Scanner.
3. Creating a Client Virtual Machine and making it vulnerable.
4. Performing a host discovery scan / adding critical assets to the VM scanner.
5. Performing an unauthenticated scan.
6. Making configurations for perform authenticated scans within the Nessus scanner.
7. Performing an authenticated scan against our vulnerable Windows 10 VM.
8. Analyzing the changes through a detailed Nessus scan report.
9. Remediating vulnerabilities.
10. Verifying remediations.

I employed the Tenable Nessus vulnerability scanner to identify and detect these vulnerabilities. Utilizing the scanner's reports and remediation recommendations, I addressed the identified issues. The project involved measuring the detected vulnerabilities via unauthenticated and authenticated scans, applying security controls to harden the environment, and analyzing the changes through a detailed Nessus scan report to confirm that the vulnerabilities had been resolved. The metrics we will show are:

- CRITICAL Vulnerabilities
- HIGH Vulnerabilities
- MEDIUM Vulnerabilities
- LOW Vulnerabilities
- INFO Vulnerabilities

## Creating our Oracle VirtualBox / Preparing a Vulnerability Management Scanner
![2024-07-02 15_56_48-Window](https://github.com/Will-Robinson-Hub/Vulnerability-Management/assets/172574754/4a31f252-4f40-4570-b146-b2584bca26a3)
I downloaded and installed the trial versions of the Tenable Nessus vulnerability scanner and Windows 10, setting them both up in my Oracle VirtualBox environment.

To make my Windows 10 machine vulnerable, I downloaded and installed very outdated versions of Firefox and VLC media player. (Note: If you have this software installed on your personal PC or anywhere in your environment, I recommend uninstalling it immediatelyâ€”just my 2 cents.)

## Performing a host discovery scan / adding critical assets to the VM scanner.

A host discovery scan is a process used to identify active devices (hosts) on a network. It involves sending various types of network probes, such as ICMP pings, TCP SYN packets, or UDP packets, to a range of IP addresses to determine which devices respond. By conducting a host discovery scan, organizations can gain a comprehensive understanding of their network environment and take appropriate security measures.

Conducting a host discovery scan and adding critical assets to the VM scanner is crucial. An asset inventory is essential for effective vulnerability management. By knowing the software and hardware components your organization uses, you can track vulnerabilities associated with specific assets and promptly apply patches or updates. This also enables you to prioritize vulnerabilities based on the impacted asset's connection to critical business functions within your organization.

## Performing an unauthenticated scan

An unauthenticated scan is a type of security assessment in which the scanner does not use any credentials (such as usernames and passwords) to access the systems being tested. Instead, the scan is conducted from an external perspective, similar to what an attacker without any prior access or knowledge of the system would do. Key characteristics and purposes of unauthenticated scans include:

1. **External Viewpoint**: It simulates how an attacker with no prior access would probe the network and systems.
2. **Identifying Exposed Services**: Helps in identifying which services and ports are open and exposed to the public, which could potentially be exploited.
3. **Basic Vulnerability Detection**: Can identify basic vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that do not require login credentials to exploit.
4. **Assessing Perimeter Security**: Useful for assessing the security of the network perimeter, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and public-facing servers.
5. **Low Impact**: Generally, it has a lower impact on network and system performance compared to authenticated scans.

However, unauthenticated scans have limitations. They might miss vulnerabilities that require deeper inspection, which can only be achieved with authenticated access. Therefore, they are often complemented by authenticated scans to provide a more comprehensive security assessment.

The architecture of project in Oracle Virtual box consists of the following components:

Virtual Machines (1 windows, 1 linux)

For the "BEFORE" metrics, all resources were initially deployed with outdated software, exposing them to vulnerabilities. The virtual machines were configured so that their network settings allowed visibility and communication within the virtual box network.

For the "AFTER" metrics, all resources were scanned and the resulting reports were evaluated. Using this information, I remediated the vulnerabilities and performed a subsequent scan to confirm the fixes.

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our Vulnerable Windows PC :

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrated the process of discovering, assessing, prioritizing, reporting, remediating and verifying remediation of vulnerabilities within a virtual network environment using Oracle VirtualBox and Tenable Nessus. By initially deploying resources with outdated software and exposed network settings, I was able to create a baseline of vulnerabilities. Through comprehensive scanning and detailed evaluation of Nessus reports, I applied targeted remediation strategies and security controls to harden the environment. Subsequent scans confirmed the effectiveness of these measures, highlighting the importance of regular vulnerability assessments and proactive security practices in maintaining a robust and secure network infrastructure.
