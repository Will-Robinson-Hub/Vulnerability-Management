In this project, I created a virtual network environment using Oracle VirtualBox and deliberately introduced vulnerabilities by installing outdated software from various sources. The project steps included:

1. Creating our Oracle VirtualBox.
2. Preparing a Vulnerability Management Scanner.
3. Creating a Client Virtual Machine and making it vulnerable.
4. Performing an unauthenticated scan.
5. Making configurations for authenticated scans within the Nessus scanner.
6. Performing an authenticated scan against our vulnerable Windows 10 VM.
7. Analyzing the changes through a detailed Nessus scan report.
8. Remediating vulnerabilities.
9. Verifying remediations.

I employed the Tenable Nessus vulnerability scanner to identify and detect these vulnerabilities. Utilizing the scanner's reports and remediation recommendations, I addressed the identified issues. The project involved measuring the detected vulnerabilities via unauthenticated and authenticated scans, applying security controls to harden the environment, and analyzing the changes through a detailed Nessus scan report to confirm that the vulnerabilities had been resolved. The metrics we will show are:

- CRITICAL Vulnerabilities
- HIGH Vulnerabilities
- MEDIUM Vulnerabilities
- LOW Vulnerabilities
- INFO Vulnerabilities

The architecture of the mini honeynet in Azure consists of the following components:

- Virtual Machines (1 windows, 1 linux)

For the "BEFORE" metrics, all resources were initially deployed with outdated software, exposing them to vulnerabilities. The virtual machines were configured so that their network settings allowed visibility and communication within the network.

For the "AFTER" metrics, all resources were scanned and the resulting reports were evaluated. Using this information, I remediated the vulnerabilities and performed a subsequent scan to confirm the fixes.

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2023-03-15 17:04:29
Stop Time 2023-03-16 17:04:29

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 19470
| Syslog                   | 3028
| SecurityAlert            | 10
| SecurityIncident         | 348
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 843

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:
Start Time 2023-03-18 15:37
Stop Time	2023-03-19 15:37

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 8778
| Syslog                   | 25
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrated the process of identifying, analyzing, and remediating vulnerabilities within a virtual network environment using Oracle VirtualBox and Tenable Nessus. By initially deploying resources with outdated software and exposed network settings, I was able to create a baseline of vulnerabilities. Through comprehensive scanning and detailed evaluation of Nessus reports, I applied targeted remediation strategies and security controls to harden the environment. Subsequent scans confirmed the effectiveness of these measures, highlighting the importance of regular vulnerability assessments and proactive security practices in maintaining a robust and secure network infrastructure.
